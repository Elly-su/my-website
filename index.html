                        I'm Elly, a Data Science student at the Cooperative University of Kenya with a strong passion for Python programming, machine learning, and building real-world tech solutions. I'm deeply curious about how data shapes decisions and the systems that power intelligent insights. My goal is to become a data engineer, using scalable tools and infrastructure to solve impactful problems. Outside of tech, I enjoy playing chess, where strategic thinking and pattern recognition fuel both my learning and creativity.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">
                         Over the past year, I've worked on several practical projects including a movie recommendation system using content-based filtering, a login authentication system using PHP and SQL, and an HR employee management database to strengthen my SQL and database design skills.

                        My technical toolkit includes Python (with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib), SQL, basic web development using HTML, CSS, and PHP, as well as version control with Git. I've also begun exploring Linux environments and recently started transitioning to Ubuntu to deepen my understanding of system-level workflows.
                        
                        I'm especially passionate about transforming raw data into structured, actionable insights and enjoy building pipelines that make this possible at scale. I plan to pursue a career in data engineering, where I can design systems that collect, process, and make data usable for analytics and AI. Outside the technical world, I'm a chess player who enjoys applying strategy and critical thinking both on and off the board.
